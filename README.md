# Data Science Resources
This list started out as a way for me to keep track of data science resources I've found helpful. However, I frequently get asked for resource recommendations by junior data scientists and friends looking to break into data science. Where possible, I've included links to the (legitimate) free versions of books. One of the great things about the data science community is the willingness to open-source and make things available for free. Within each category the resources are listed very loosely in order of usefulness/introductory level to more advanced (but not entirely).

This list is far from complete, but I'll try to continue to add to it. Hopefully you find it helpful.

Non-exhaustive list of additional topics to add:
 - Spark
 - Git/GitHub
 - time series forecasting
 - MLops
 - docker
